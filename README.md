Vim-For-Docs is a browser extension that brings Vim-like navigation and editing functionality to Google Docs. With Vim-For-Docs, you can navigate, edit, and manipulate your documents using familiar Vim commands—now with a new default "vim" theme that displays a full-width overlay at the bottom. The left side of the overlay shows the current mode, while the right side shows the pending motion buffer.

> **Note:** This extension intercepts keystrokes before they reach Google Docs’ internal editor and remaps them to simulate Vim motions. It is designed for users who love Vim’s efficient navigation and editing style.

| `A`                | Go to end of line and insert                            |

*Note: Redo is bound to `r` rather than `Ctrl + r` since the latter reloads the browser.

## Visual Mode Commands
| **Key(s)** | **Action** |
|------------|------------|
| `d`        | (In visual mode, used for deleting the selected text) |
| `Esc`      | Exit visual mode |
| `y`        | Yank (copy) selection |
| `p`        | Paste over selection |
| `u`        | Undo |
| `r`        | Redo |

## Special Line Commands
| **Key(s)** | **Action** |
|------------|------------|
| `cc`       | Change (cut and switch to insert mode) the current line(s) |
| `C`        | Equivalent to “c$”: change from the cursor to the end of the line |
| `D`        | Equivalent to “d$”: delete from the cursor to the end of the line |
| `Y`        | Equivalent to “y$”: yank from the cursor to the end of the line |
| `P`        | Paste before the cursor |

## Numeric Prefix
A numeric count (e.g., 2, 3, etc.) can be prefixed to motions or operators to repeat the command multiple times (for example, `2w`, `3dd`, or `4daw`).

## Key Modifiers in Event Simulation
| **Key(s)** | **Action** |
|------------|------------|
| `Shift`    | Used to alter movement (e.g., for text selection) |
| `Control`  | Used for accelerated navigation (word/paragraph jumps) and special commands |

## Known Limitations
Due to browser restrictions and the Google Docs environment, some Vim commands have been modified or are unavailable:
- **Control + w:** In insert mode, this shortcut is disabled to avoid closing the current tab.
- **^ Command:** The `^` command does not work on the first line of the document.
- **Redo:** We use `r` for redo instead of `Ctrl + r` (which reloads the browser).
- **Visual Mode "U":** Undo functionality in visual mode (typically bound to `U`) is not supported by Google Docs.

## How It Works
Vim-For-Docs intercepts key events from the Google Docs iframe and remaps them to Vim-like motions. The extension:
- **Maps keys:** For example, `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for basic navigation.
- **Handles multi-key commands:** Such as `gg` and `ge` for document navigation.
- **Switches modes:** Between Normal, Insert, and Visual, with the "vim" theme providing a full-width overlay that shows the current mode and pending command.
- **Simulates keystroke events:** To interact with Google Docs’ editing surface.
